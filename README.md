## Description
This project is an automatic poultry feeding system designed to help manage feeding schedules for poultry farms. It uses an Arduino-based controller and an LCD screen for user interface, alongside a servo motor for dispensing food.
## Features

- Automated feeding system
- LCD display to show feeding schedule
- Push button for manual operation
- Adjustable feeding schedule


## Installation

To install and run the Automatic Poultry Feeder project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rogatemangiwa/arduino_autofeede.git
   cd arduino_autofeeder
```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the hardware (Arduino, Servo Motor, LCD, and Push Buttons) as per the wiring instructions.
 
4. Select the appropriate board and port:
    - Go to Tools > Board and choose your Arduino model (e.g., Arduino Uno).
    - Go to Tools > Port and select the correct port.
5. Upload the code to the Arduino board:
    - Click on the Upload button in Arduino IDE.
6. The system will now be ready to use!
## Usage/Examples
1. Set the feeding schedule using the push buttons.
2. The system will automatically dispense food at the scheduled times.
3. Monitor the system status on the LCD screen.



## How it Works
The system uses an Arduino to control a servo motor that dispenses food at the programmed times. The LCD screen displays the feeding schedule, and the push button allows manual feeding or adjusting settings.
